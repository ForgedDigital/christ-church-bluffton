### 2026-02-20 — Website Forms & Tithe.ly Overview

**Subject:** Website Forms — How They Work & Tithe.ly Integration

Hi team,

This is additional information regarding the website contact forms. This is especially useful for anyone who will be managing the administration side of Tithe.ly and contacts.

**Overview**

The website has three forms: Contact, Prayer Request, and Stay Updated. Each form sends data to two places:

1. **Tithe.ly** — Populates under the People tab automatically
2. **Email** — Sends a notification to a designated email address (currently going to admin@christchurchbluffton.org)

Having both routes is intentional — servers skip a beat sometimes, so having a backup ensures nothing gets missed.

**Contact Form**

- Required fields: Full Name, Email, Interest (as shown on the temporary site link)
- Name, email, and phone auto-populate in Tithe.ly under People
- An email notification is sent with all submitted info including the contact message and reason for reaching out — Tithe.ly's system does not display that information, so the email is the only place to see it

**Prayer Request**

- When someone submits a prayer request, it also comes into Tithe.ly (we can remove this if preferred)
- If a name is entered, it generates under People in Tithe.ly
- If no name is entered, it comes in as "Anonymous" in both the email and Tithe.ly
- The prayer text itself is only sent via email — I'd recommend setting up a dedicated address like prayers@christchurchbluffton.org down the road, but we can handle that later

**Stay Updated (Footer)**

- A simple email-only signup for users who want to receive church updates without sharing their name or other info
- Once email communications begin going out, I'd recommend adding a note that if recipients no longer wish to receive emails, they can reply requesting to be removed

**Tithe.ly Saved Filters**

Each form submission automatically tags the person in Tithe.ly — "Contact Form," "Prayer Request," or "Stay Updated." I've created saved filters for each tag under the People tab (left column > Saved Filters) so you can quickly view submissions by type. I've left the test submissions in Tithe.ly for now so those who will be working with it can use the saved filters and see how entries come in.

**Family Setup**

I've added my family in Tithe.ly so Judy or whoever will be managing it can start exploring the family features and get familiar with the system.

**Next Steps**

Once Google Workspace is fully set up and email addresses are generated, we'll configure the notification routing properly. While you can't catch them all, I will add spam protection measures — including CAPTCHA and honeypot fields — to all forms before they go live. These won't eliminate every spam submission, but they'll filter out the vast majority of bots and junk entries.

Note: All Resend and Netlify environment variable configurations will need to be repeated on the production URL before going live.
